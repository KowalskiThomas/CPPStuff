# C++Stuff

This repository is a collection of fun, tricky or simply interesting C++ idioms, modern features or gotchas, that I started writing concurrently with my reading of these two (great) books :

* Effective Modern C++ (by Scott Meyers)
* More Exceptional C++ (by Herb Sutter)

They should compile without any issues on any modern C++ compiler.
